## Backbone Model
You can use the following [link](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) to download the model.
## Run Steps
We utilize the codes from [here](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/VideoLLaMA2) to finetune model. You can run:
```bash
bash scrips/custom/finetune_lora.sh
```
You need to replace:
```bash
--model_path --vision_tower --pretrain_mm_mlp_adapter --data_path --output_dir
```
with your file_path. If you encounter any issues during the reproduction process, please don’t hesitate to let us know — we will assist you promptly.
